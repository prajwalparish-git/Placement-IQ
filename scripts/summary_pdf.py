</div></header>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Engineering students prepare for campus placements with generic material that ignores their
resume, their target role and their own weak topics, and general-purpose AI chatbots give
unchecked, unrepeatable advice. PlacementIQ is a multi-agent system that turns a resume and a
target role into a personal, self-correcting preparation loop. A profile agent extracts skills;
code computes a readiness score and the missing skills against a role-to-skill map. A planner
agent writes a seven-day study plan weighted to the weakest topics, a quiz agent sets adaptive
multiple-choice quizzes, and an interviewer agent runs {rounds} mock interviews with follow-up
questions and scored feedback. A critic, built from deterministic checks followed by an LLM
judge in a LangGraph generate&ndash;verify&ndash;retry loop, verifies every generated output and
forces regeneration when it fails. Quiz scores update each topic&rsquo;s weakness, which reshapes
the next week&rsquo;s plan. On {n} frozen evaluation cases against a single-prompt baseline,
PlacementIQ produced valid plans in {_pct(p["plan_valid_rate"])} of cases (baseline
{_pct(b["plan_valid_rate"])}) and valid quizzes in {_pct(p["quiz_valid_rate"])} (baseline
{_pct(b["quiz_valid_rate"])}). It runs as one Streamlit application with one SQLite file on a
free LLM tier, and fully offline in a mock mode.</p>
<p class="kw"><b>Keywords:</b> multi-agent systems, large language models, LangGraph, critic
agent, adaptive learning, placement preparation, Streamlit, SQLite.</p>

<h2>Key features</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Resume profiling:</b> a PDF, DOCX or TXT resume against one of {_words(len(roles()))}
roles gives a readiness score, matched and missing skills, and concrete resume fixes.</li>
<li><b>Adaptive weekly plan:</b> seven days of study with minutes weighted to weak topics, the
reason for the plan, the shift from last week, day check-off and export to calendar (.ics) or
CSV.</li>
<li><b>Adaptive quizzes:</b> topics ranked by weakness, difficulty suggested from recent scores,
{_words(QUIZ_SIZE)} questions never repeated from the student&rsquo;s history, and an answer
review saved as notes.</li>
<li><b>Mock interviews:</b> {rounds} rounds; follow-ups on vague answers; each answer scored on
{_join(CRITERIA)}, with a model answer and a session summary.</li>
<li><b>Critic loop on every output:</b> free deterministic checks first, then an LLM critic;
only rejected questions are rewritten, approved ones are cached, and every step is shown as a
trail.</li>
<li><b>Closed feedback loop:</b> quiz results change topic weakness, quiz difficulty and the next
week&rsquo;s plan automatically.</li>
<li><b>Progress dashboard:</b> readiness over time, study streak, 12-week activity calendar,
topic mastery with trends, interview scores, and agent and critic statistics.</li>
<li><b>Built-in evaluation:</b> a resumable harness compares PlacementIQ with a single-prompt
baseline on {n} frozen cases; a Results page explains each metric.</li>
<li><b>Practical to run:</b> offline mock mode, light and dark themes, phone-readable layout,
free-tier Groq models, 400+ automated offline tests and CI.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="page">Problems it solves</h2>
<table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Problem</th><th>How PlacementIQ solves it</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Students do not know how ready they are for a role or which skills are
missing.</td><td>A readiness score and missing-skill list computed by code from the resume and a
role-to-skill map, so it is explainable and repeatable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Preparation is generic and unplanned, with no focus on personal weak
areas.</td><td>A day-by-day weekly plan that gives the most time to the weakest topics and
states why.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Study plans stay fixed while the student improves or falls behind.</td>
<td>Quiz scores update topic weakness and difficulty; the next plan shifts minutes
accordingly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>AI-generated content is unreliable: invalid plans, wrong answer keys, ambiguous
or duplicate questions.</td><td>Every output passes deterministic checks and a critic before it
is shown; plan validity {plans}, quiz validity {quizzes} for a single prompt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Practice repeats the same questions.</td><td>Questions are hashed and checked
against everything the student was asked before{_repeats(summary, topics)}.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Little access to realistic interview practice with feedback.</td>
<td>On-demand mock interviews with follow-ups on vague answers{followups}, rubric scores and a
model answer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Progress is invisible, so motivation and course-correction suffer.</td>
<td>A dashboard of readiness over time, streak, activity and topic mastery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Paid tools and complex infrastructure put AI coaching out of reach.</td>
<td>Free LLM tier, one process and one database file, and an offline mode for lab
machines.</td></tr>
