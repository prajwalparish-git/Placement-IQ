"""Voice Interview Agent for Skill Scout Nexus (Step 5 Mock Voice Interview Architecture).

Responsibilities:
- Converts interview questions into realistic spoken audio using ElevenLabs TTS API
  (`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`) via high-speed streaming/REST requests.
- Provides fallback to browser SpeechSynthesis / data URI synthetic wavs if API key is not present.
- Generates realistic role-specific behavioral, technical, and situational scenario questions
  tailored across student streams:
  * Engineering: System design & coding logic.
  * Commerce: Financial audit scenario & GST filing dispute.
  * Law: Moot court scenario & contractual breach interpretation.
  * Management: HR grievance handling & marketing case study.
- Seamlessly interfaces with Streamlit frontend.
