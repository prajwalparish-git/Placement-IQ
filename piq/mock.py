"""Deterministic canned responses for MOCK_MODE (UI work, tests, offline demo).

Each function receives the same `context` the real prompt was built from and
returns a JSON-able dict that must pass the same schema + checks as real output.
Mock output is plausible, not intelligent; never use it for evaluation results.

Deliberate exception: the quiz agent's FIRST attempt contains one flawed question
(duplicate options) so the critic's reject -> regenerate loop is visible offline.
