"""Syllabus: each career domain's topics, each role's focus topics, and topic colour slots.

data/career_catalog.json lists the domains: their topics in a fixed order (the n-th topic takes
the n-th topic colour) and how many leading topics every student of the domain tracks
(`core_topics`; the six CS core topics, otherwise just Aptitude). data/role_skills.json maps
each role's required skills to those topics. A student tracks their role's focus topics plus
any other topic of the domain they have chosen to quiz. Pure data, no Streamlit.
