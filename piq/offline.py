"""Layer 3's last tier: deterministic answers built from data/ when no AI provider answers.

piq/llm.py calls `respond` when every provider is unset, resting or down (and
AI_OFFLINE_FALLBACK is on), so the student keeps working without a single error. Each answer
passes the same schema and checks as a model's. Unlike MOCK_MODE (piq/mock.py), nothing here
is labelled or carries the demo's deliberate flaw: a student who is offline sees ordinary
content.

- quiz: questions from the question bank (data/questions/mcq_bank.csv) on the topic, at the
  difficulty asked, then the neighbouring ones; never one the student has already been asked.
- profile: the role's required skills (data/role_skills.json) matched in the resume's words.
- interviewer: the domain track's focus (data/interview_tracks.json) or the generic bank.
- planner: minutes weighted to the weakest topics. evaluator: scores from length and STAR
  markers, with the fixed coaching tips for the weakest criteria (config.INTERVIEW_TIPS).
