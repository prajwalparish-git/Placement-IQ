"""The only module that talks to an LLM.

`call()` = JSON mode + Pydantic validation + one repair retry + agent_logs row.

Which provider answers is Layer 3's job (core/ai_router.py): Groq, Gemini or a local Ollama,
with key pools, circuit breakers and a prompt cache. When none can answer, the offline tier
(piq/offline.py, built from data/) answers instead, silently, unless AI_OFFLINE_FALLBACK=false
(the evaluation), in which case the failure is raised: `RateLimited` when every provider that
was tried is out of quota, else `LLMError`. In MOCK_MODE the response comes from `piq.mock`
without touching the network. Either way the output goes through the same validation, and
only a validated answer is stored in the prompt cache.
